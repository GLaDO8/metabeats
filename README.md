MetaBeats helps you find perfect album covers, artist names, genre, year of release etc for your music library. No more scraping the internet for Meta information!

## UPDATE: its a non-functional static site for now. I'm still working on the APIs. Also, the website isn't responsive yet, so probably won't render properly on a mobile browser.
